# DataMall

This repository is created to showcase some visualisations to find out road conditions on a particular day on the Singapore map.

What we know about this visualisation is the whereabouts of a the current location road works, heavy traffic and vehicle breakdown. 

On a good day when the traffic is smooth, there are fewer accidents. As there are fewer obstructions and driving tends to be easier when there are fewer danger spots. In addition, when faced with heavy traffic conditions, risky behaviours such as weaving in and out tends to happen, or faced with time pressure, such as morning rush hours, school zone hours, one tends to make mistakes. Or with many vehicles on a busy road, the likelihood of an accident happening may increase significantly.

First I would like to explore what we can do with DataMall. The great thing about it is we can create a map that is interactive and let us gain some insights to it.

This visualisation is showing all the bus stops plotted in different colours are the road names that are along the particular road. What we can see when we mouse over each stop is the latitude and longitude of the bus stop including other information available.

To further showcase what is achievable, we will  plot the pictures in 3 layers.

This visualisation shows one bus route(in blue) passing through the hotspots from LTA(in red) and from the accident database(in black).
